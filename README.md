# Project Overview

This project investigates movie data sourced from Box Office Mojo (BOM) and the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) for the years 2010 to 2018. The aim is to offer insights to GAT INC, assisting in their decision-making process regarding potential expansion into the movie production industry.

The analysis encompasses fundamental market metrics and extends to additional metrics beyond the project's scope, providing a comprehensive view of the industry landscape.

# Business Challenge

GAT INC aims to diversify its portfolio as a movie studio by aligning movie audience preferences with different market segments.

The focus lies in identifying movie genres, assessing movie durations, and understanding their roles as predictors of sales. Through market segmentation and the exploration of the relationships between these variables, the study aims to provide valuable insights. Trends and patterns related to movie genres, ratings, movie durations, domestic and foreign sales, and global sales are analyzed.

# Data Understanding 

Understanding the data involves consolidating information from two distinct movie databases covering the years 2010 to 2018. The dataset originates from two separate sources: a SQL database and a CSV file. Prior to merging, thorough preprocessing and cleaning procedures are applied. Additionally, feature engineering techniques are utilized to establish a new market segment. To support initial insights and enhance visualization capabilities, categorical variable is encoded.

# Exploratory Data Analysis
During the exploratory data analysis phase, I will investigate patterns, variations, and other characteristics relevant to the business inquiries. Simultaneously, I will scrutinize the data for irregularities and recognize any constraints it may have.

# Importing the databases
Begin by importing the data and converting it into a pandas dataframe.
Data from IMDB is located in a SQLite database will be imported first.To address the business problem tables movie_basic and movie_ratings will be used. The dataframe for analysis created by joining movie basics and moving ratings tables. Data from the Box Office Mojo is a csv file.
 
## Explore and Examine IMDB data

## To address the business inquiry and provide actionable insights:
1.  Analysis will entail movie genres as a predictor of  sales, average rating, and runtime.
2. Investigate the relationship between movie length (runtime), average rating, and sales across different market segments
3. Explore how movie length(runtime) correlates with  sales.
4. Assess geographical market segmentation, aligning with the company's areas of interest.
## Drop unnecessary columns
movie_db.drop(['start_year' ,'movieID', 'studio'], axis=1, inplace=True)
## Feature Engineering Global Sales
To address business inquiries, particularly regarding market segmentation,  I established a global sales column by aggregating both foreign and domestic sales.
# Descriptive Statistics

### Findings: 
The findings reveal that between 2010 and 2018, there was a decline in the quantity of movies produced.
Simultaneously, both foreign and global sales experienced significant upward trends, whereas domestic sales showed a moderate increase. This suggests an inverse relationship between the variables during the specified period. 

## Analysis of Genres
Genre analysis involves grouping genres to examine their relationships with other variables in the dataset, such as average rating, movie length, and sales. By categorizing genres based on these factors, I obtained gainful insights into their interrelationships and their impact on various aspects of the dataset.
There are 260 different genres in the dataset.To  identify the genre that appears most frequently the mode of the 'genres' column in the movie_db dataset is determined  to be "Drama"

### Top Rating Genres

# Correlation Analysis
    
![image](https://github.com/durrantX/dsc-phase-2--project/assets/148919288/59e8dd96-9524-435b-97ce-8ac7f44d0af7)
### Findings
 The correlation coefficient between runtime_minutesâ€™ and â€˜averageratingâ€™ is 0.25, between  â€˜runtime_minutesâ€™ and â€˜global_salesâ€™ is 0.19 and between â€˜averageratingâ€™ and â€˜global_salesâ€™ is 0.17.
All correlations observed are positive, suggesting that as one variable increases, the other tends to increase as well.  Market correlations are significant; however, their correlation with movie runtime and average rating is notably lower compared to other variables. These correlations can guide decision-making in areas of movie production and marketing   
# Additional analysis
Linear regression statistcal modeling will be used to provide better insights by uncovering patterns and relationships to better inform  business  decisions. 
### Linear regression with runtime as the predictor of global sales 
### Findings 
 The ordinary least square  regression was used to test if  movie length(runtime_minutes) significantly predicted gross sales.
Coefficients of the model
The intercept(const ): -8.354e+07 runtime_minutes  1.976e+06
The fitted regression model was: Global Sales=-8.354e+07+1.976e+06*runtime_minutes
Suggesting that for every additional minute in movie length, global sales are expected to increase by 1.976e+06 units($1,976,000).

R-squared: 0.036, 
Adj. R-squared:0.037 
Approximately 3.6 percent of the variability in global sales can be explained by the length of the movie.
 F-statistic is 65.31,  low p-value,  (Prob (F-statistic):  1.18e-15) suggesting that the regression model is statistically significant. 

Overall, the regression model suggests that there is a statistically significant positive relationship between the runtime of movies and their global sales. However, the low R-squared value indicates that the model explains only a small portion of the variance in gross sales, suggesting that other factors not included in the model may also influence  global sales.

 ### Run a Simple Linear Regression with runtime  as the Predictor and domestic sales as dependent variable 

As previous  analysis above indicates, the length of the movie has a realtionship with sales.  Analysis delves further   quantifying the strength of the relationship in the domestic and foreign market.     
### Findings 
 The ordinary least square  regression was used to test if  movie length(runtime_minutes) significantly predicted doemestic sales.
Coefficients:
The intercept (const) is  -18,440,000.
runtime_minutes  6.351e+05 
The fitted regression model was:Domestic gross= -18,440,000+6.351e+05*runtime_minutes
The coefficient for the predictor variable runtime_minutes is approximately 635,100. This means that for each additional minute of runtime, the domestic gross is estimated to increase by approximately $635,100.
R-squared:  0.025
Adjusted R-squared: 0.024.
R-squared is 0.025, indicating that approximately 2.5 percent of the variance in domestic gross is explained by the predictor variable (runtime_minutes).
F-statistic: 44.97 and  low probability (p < 0.001)indicating that the overall model is statistically significant.
Overall the regression model suggests that there is a statistically significant positive relationship between the runtime of movies and their domestic gross. However, the R-squared value indicates that the model explains only a small proportion of the variance in domestic gross, suggesting that other factors not included in the model is  influencing domestic gross.
 
# OLS with movie ratings(averagerating) as the predictor and global sales as dependent variable
The ordinary least square  regression was used to test if  movie ratings(averagerating) significantly predicted global sales
Coefficients:
The intercept (const) is  --1.037e+08 
averagerating   3.613e+07
The fitted regression model was:Global sales = -1.037e+08 +3.613e+07*averagerating.
The coefficient for the predictor variable averagerating is approximately 36 million dollars. This means that for each additional  unit of average rating  the global sales is estimated to increase by approximately 36M dollars.
R-squared:  0.029
Adjusted R-squared: 0.028.
R-squared is 0.029, indicating that approximately 2.9 percent of the variance in global sales is explained by the predictor variable (averagerating).
F-statistic: 52.69 and  low probability (p < 0.001)indicating that the overall model is statistically significant.
Overall the regression model suggests that there is a statistically significant positive relationship between the  averageratings of movies and their global sales. However, the R-squared value indicates that the model explains only a small proportion of the variance in global sales, suggesting that other factors not included in the model is  influencing global sales.
# Runtime as the predictor of average rating
### Findings 
The R-squared value, is 0.061. This suggests that approximately 6.1% of the variance in movie ratings can be explained by the independent variable (runtime_minutes).

Coefficients:
The coefficient for the runtime_minutes variable is 0.0122. 
This indicates that, on average, for each additional minute in the runtime of a movie, the average rating is expected to increase by approximately 0.0122 units.

The F-statistic is 115.1 with a very low p-value (4.64e-26), indicating that the overall regression model is statistically significant.
 The regression results indicate that there is a statistically significant but modest positive relationship between movie runtime and average rating. The model explains only a small proportion of the variance in movie ratings, suggesting that other factors beyond runtime also influence the average rating of movies.
